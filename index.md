An artist does not have any defined language; she speaks worldwide through her artworks. Art has many ways to interpret the meaning, and its open-ended vibe makes it gorgeous. Artists have the capacity to bring people under one umbrella to ask for peace. I plan to work with young artists to enhance them and spread this message to society. When the culture of people becomes affable to accept another culture, heaven will be the earth, in my thought.
